# responsive-website

The aim of my project is to produce a website which will be a point of contact for customers to be able to get information on the services that Prominent Designs can provide. Customers can sign up to newsletter which will keep them up to date and also to be a service which helps businesses grow. I aim to also understand the principles in what makes a website experience successful and to be able to reproduce a website which will reflect to a potential customer what they can have for themselves. What I intend to achieve by designing and developing a website is to have a clear and easily understandable interface that users of different levels can be able to understand as they may not be experts and most likely will be the reason why they will need to hire my services as I will be able to do the things which they find difficult.

The main issues faced in my area of research was that there are principles and factors that you must consider before designing a website to ensure its success. Different factors for a successful website include an easy to navigate website, A experience to make users want to come back and use the website again, An interface which is clear and understandable to users of all levels.
