# responsive-website

The aim of my project is to produce a website which will be a point of contact for customers to be able to get information on the services that Prominent Designs can provide. Customers can sign up to newsletter which will keep them up to date and also to be a service which helps businesses grow. I aim to also understand the principles in what makes a website experience successful and to be able to reproduce a website which will reflect to a potential customer what they can have for themselves. What I intend to achieve by designing and developing a website is to have a clear and easily understandable interface that users of different levels can be able to understand as they may not be experts and most likely will be the reason why they will need to hire my services as I will be able to do the things which they find difficult.

The main issues faced in my area of research was that there are principles and factors that you must consider before designing a website to ensure its success. Different factors for a successful website include an easy to navigate website, A experience to make users want to come back and use the website again, An interface which is clear and understandable to users of all levels.

“Good User Experience is Good Business” (Garrett, 2011)

The average age of the UK business owner is between 49-51 which is 2.92% of the UK population found out by Finder UK. Finder UK also researched genders of business owners and businesses by identifying the CEOs titles e.g. Mr or Mrs, whilst 72% were male which means there are more male UK business owners than female.

These results do not represent the other percentage of business owners in the UK which are aged under 50 who also own businesses, which is 25.08% of business owners aged between 23-43.  This is still a large percentage of the entire UK population which is 65.6 million.

My intended target audience for my project will be small business owners aged between 23-43 Male and Female. I aim to target customers who are from London as it has a reputation for leading in digital tech start-up with an average of 7682 start up births between 2011-2015 and that number has grown considerably, however a high percentage also tend to fail within their first few years, My belief is that a website and strategic planning could help businesses succeed.

Target audience background is technology and business. I am targeting small business owners who just need to be guided digitally. The technology background is in relation to the new technology age we live such as in The Internet, Mobile phones, Social media etc. Their culture is held by the millennials who keep up with trends on Social Media as I will intend to develop my website from only being online but to also have a Social Media presence on platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

I have looked into similar websites which are within the same field as Prominent Designs and what I have found is that there are quite a few which provide a similar service which is Marketing Consultancy, and helping people grow their business. I researched two products which were BDA a business development advisor and The Online Marketing Consultancy.

I found that they are both prominent examples of online media and marketing consultants as they offer a broad range of services and have successful websites which give a good user experience. They both have their own strengths and weaknesses and what I found was that the strengths these websites had like others is they have a clear layout which is understandable to users of all levels.

Weaknesses was that some website do overload their site with too much information which can lead to impatience of the user if they have to go through lots of volume of content.

“The web consists of volumes of information, which is sometimes disorganized and difficult to get through. In order to make any sense out of the information, the reader must often resort to trial and error to ferret out logic that should have been organized and made obvious by the author” (Lyons, 2001)

I have built on this by designing a website which has three main pages that gives all the information the user needs to know. “Home”, “About” and “Services”. The user can be able to see which services they can receive, how to contact Prominent Designs, get a quote to find out how much a service will cost, sign up to newsletters which keeps them up-to-date etc. These are all important significant information that is easy to find.

Technologies which I have employed for the production of this project includes my Macbook Pro 13” 2015. This is the hardware which was my choice for developing a website. The 13” display gives me an understanding of how the website is responsive on screens which are smaller as a high number of users I am targeting will be either tablet users or laptops as small business owners tend to be on the go.

Software I used to develop my site is Adobe Dreamweaver which is a comprehensive website authoring program for Mac and Windows OS’s. Dreamweaver allows the programmer to type HTML and .CSS codes to build and design/style. This software is innovative in the use of digital media as it enables the programmer to preview his website whilst developing simultaneously and also has built in templates to also assist programmers in the initial stages of development.

Advantages of being on the web is that it is a platform which is accessible 24/7 and around the world, it also is low cost to maintain.

As this is a website the distribution platform will be on the web. Affiliate Marketing is also a method which I will impose to distribute the Prominent Designs website and reach target audience. The process of affiliate marketing is promoting other companies products or have a link to their website through your site and you earn profit each time a user clicks on to the link, what I can do is promote my website on other similar companies websites.

Prominent Designs has been designed to be interactive with customers. They can sign up to our newsletters and get a quote whilst on the site, I aim to develop the interactivity by adding into it a blog section and a comment section in the future.

My project plan and outline of the time frame of this website will run along the duration of three months. I allocated 3 months to evenly distribute the production phases of research (1month), production (1month) and evaluation (1 month). Researching the market to find a niche to tackle was my main aim of research as to be able to come up with a business idea that is going to be sustainable as I found that a high percentage of start up businesses fail within their first year.

I researched fields in web design businesses and realized that the most profitable is companies do not only design websites for other companies but they also support businesses by marketing them, this adds more value to the business. I researched demographics and statistics as to be able to design a website that will give the targeted audience satisfaction.

After careful research of finding out what are the main aims of the website I initiated my design, I came up with a plan for my chosen project. Following this I began the production and I edited and developed the whole website within one month which was the timeframe I allocated to myself. Main challenges was to keep my website consistent within font, format, colours used and sizes of images etc.

Evaluation helped guide my understanding of what remained to be accomplished and testing showed me the standards and quality of the interface of the website. I did a heuristic evaluation using Jakob Nielsens 10 Usabilty Principles to give me qualitative results that I can go back to work on and develop my website for the better.

There are three main phases of production in all projects which is “Pre-Production”, “Production” and “Post Production”. During the pre-production phases it is initially planning and research. The main challenges I faced was to ensure I had analyzed the target audience and end user, what content I had already available. With this I was the able to define a strategy for a visual style and structure which meets these end goals.

The problems which I faced was to be able to design a website which was easily understandable so I looked into the interfaces websites use to make sure what I developed had a similar experience, I developed a website with three main pages to do this, The home page, an About page which is conventional in many websites in the current web trends and a page which explains the services I will provide and a form a user can fill in to be able to create a quote.

I combined my structure plan and content to develop the website and start coding my Style CSS page which is one another challenge I faced when producing the Prominent Designs website. Style CSS describes how the HTML elements will be displayed on the internet, desktops, tablets and smart phones, also by using media querie codes which makes the page respond to different sizes making the site responsive. I produced all textual content and formatted them to fit within the sites structure, also edited assets on Photoshop and Illustrator to be imported into the site.

Whilst producing I constantly previewed and tested the interface of my website by using Dreamweavers preview page to keep on the path so that I can implement the interface to give good user experience. A challenge which I faced was back-end development of the webpage as it uses forms and newsletters. At the current moment of time I have completed the front-end of the web page with the back-end needed to be completed before publishing physically.

Post-production was to make sure that the site is functional by ensuring all the HTML is coded. After the webpage is completed the aim is that it will reach its target audience as soon as it is launched. I did this by including keywords and meta tags into the websites HTML which optimizes the site to be top of results on search engines such as Google, Yahoo and Bing. 

To receive user testing I asked creative like minded friends who are into design and are developers of content (e.g. social media influencers and social media page managers) 10 Heuristic Principle questions to determine whether or not my website goals were met. My method of evaluation was observation and a heuristic approach evaluation created by Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich.


“A Heuristic Evaluation is a usability inspection technique where one or a number of usability experts evaluate the user interface of a product (for example a website) against a set of Heuristic Principles (also known as Heuristics).” (Muniz, 2016)

Conclusion

I believe that my project has the right idea and is also innovative, it can become a successful viable business idea than can become profitable and expand into other markets and provide further services. I wanted to develop a website which would help people so that their businesses can grow as in this day and age more people are wanting to be able to have their own ideas become a real company or business and with Prominent Designs I can assist them with this. My aim was to then create a website which was consistent in standards of conventional websites such as icons and buttons and forms.

I kept my website consistent in terms of the colours I used and fonts which worked well. It is important that the website is also interactive and responsive to be more accessible and have a good user experience on cross devices with different screen sizes. I built the website to be responsive so that the images and icons stack over each other when it is seen on a smaller screen and that the menu bar on the right of the navigation bar squeezes into the middle.

My design experiences was a good learning curve as I learnt the use of different Styling elements of CSS codes and what they do. I made all clickable buttons highlight to an orange colour to communicate to the user that the button is interactive. I found it useful that I worked on Adobe Dreamweaver as it is a powerful tool when coding for a website with the option to preview your website whilst working on it.

My improvements which I will propose and I will further study is also back-end development as I have currently built a website that is fully functional on the front end, coded and styled, but the back end will ensure that my forms are functional and I will have a database which will store users email addresses for when they sign up to the newsletter, I have looked into services which do this such as MailChimp.

I feel that this project is one of the first avenues I aim to go into as this will exercise my skills in building websites which is one of the most important assets that all businesses must have.
